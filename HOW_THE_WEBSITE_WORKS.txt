  INDRA NET — How This Website Works
  A Plain-Language Technical Explanation
================================================================

WHAT IS THIS WEBSITE?
─────────────────────
INDRA NET is a Next.js web application — a dashboard/control
panel that simulates and displays a sovereign Indian defense
mesh communication network. It is built to look and feel like
a real military operations center, but runs entirely in the
browser. No real hardware is connected; all data is simulated.


TECHNOLOGY USED
───────────────
  Framework  : Next.js 14 (React-based, runs on Node.js)
  Language   : TypeScript + TSX (typed JavaScript for UI)
  Animations : Framer Motion (smooth page/card animations)
  Icons      : Lucide React (Shield, Wifi, Radio, etc.)
  Fonts      : JetBrains Mono (terminal text), Montserrat/Inter
  CSS        : Inline styles + globals.css (dark theme, grid bg)


OVERALL LAYOUT STRUCTURE
────────────────────────
Every page shares the same shell (defined in layout.tsx):

  ┌────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │  SIDEBAR (240px wide, always visible) │
  │  - Navigation links to all pages      │
  ├────────────────────────────────────────┤
  │  MAIN CONTENT AREA (rest of screen)   │
  │  - Each page renders its own content  │
  └────────────────────────────────────────┘

The dark background (#0A0A0A) with a subtle cyan grid is applied
globally via layout.tsx — every page inherits this automatically.


PAGE-BY-PAGE EXPLANATION
────────────────────────

── 1. HOME PAGE  (src/app/page.tsx)
   The "Global Operations Center" — the main dashboard.

   What you see:
   • A spinning 3D Digital Twin node (rendered via Three.js /
     WebGL in the DigitalTwinNode component).
   • A "System Health Monitor" showing 5 live metrics:
       - Network Stability (99.8%)
       - Active Mesh Nodes (14)
       - Encryption (AES-128 ACTIVE)
       - Cognitive Frequency (433.5 MHz)
       - Edge Latency (12ms)
   • A terminal log at the bottom that scrolls through system
     messages every 1.4 seconds automatically.

   How it works in code:
   • useEffect() starts a setInterval timer that cycles through
     a list of log messages, appending them to the visible list.
   • Framer Motion animates cards sliding in from left/right.
   • The 3D node loads separately (dynamic import) so it doesn't
     block the rest of the page from loading.

── 2. MESH TOPOLOGY  (src/app/mesh-topology/page.tsx)
   A live interactive network graph simulation.

   What you see:
   • 14 mesh nodes drawn on an HTML Canvas, connected by links.
   • Nodes gently float and repel each other (physics simulation).
   • Animated "data packets" (cyan dots) travel along the links.
   • A slider to simulate radio INTERFERENCE (0–100%).
   • As you increase interference, nodes "fail" (turn red) and
     the network reconfigures around them automatically.
   • Frequency hopping display updates as interference increases.

   How it works in code:
   • Canvas API + requestAnimationFrame draws 60fps animation.
   • Each node has (x, y, vx, vy) — position and velocity.
   • A force algorithm pushes nodes apart and pulls linked nodes
     toward each other, creating organic-looking movement.
   • The interference slider calls generateNodes(value) which
     randomly marks some nodes as "failed", and generateLinks()
     rebuilds the connection paths around active nodes only.

── 3. CYBER VAULT  (src/app/cyber-vault/page.tsx)
   A security monitoring and simulation dashboard.

   What you see:
   • Encrypted Packet Stream — scrolling random hex/symbol text
     that looks like live encrypted data flowing.
   • Decryption Engine — animated progress bar (AES-128-CBC).
   • Authentication Status — shows AUTHENTICATED or VERIFYING.
   • Adversarial Simulation — a big button "INJECT MALICIOUS NODE":
       → Clicking it triggers a 9-step threat response sequence
         (one log line appears every 700ms in a terminal view).
       → Hardware Fingerprint panel highlights a rogue MAC address.
       → After all steps complete, system shows THREAT NEUTRALIZED.
   • Edge Inference Latency — a live bar chart that updates every
     500ms showing ~12ms latency values in green (red if >16ms).
   • Active Security Policies list (Zero-Trust, Remote Wipe, etc.)

   How it works in code:
   • setInterval every 200ms adds a new random character line to
     the crypto stream (creates the "live hacking" effect).
   • The inject() function chains multiple setInterval timers to
     reveal threat log lines one by one with precise timing.
   • useState manages all the live state: auth status, logs,
     fingerprint, latency data, injection status.

── 4. STRATEGIC INTELLIGENCE  (src/app/strategic-intelligence/page.tsx)
   A government briefing / impact analysis page.

   What you see:
   • R&D Cost Optimization card — shows Digital Twin reduces
     R&D cost by 70% (₹75 Lakh vs ₹2.5 Crore). Animated bars
     grow from 0 to their actual widths when the page loads.
   • INDRA NET vs Satellite comparison table — 7 features
     compared side-by-side (latency, cost, jamming resistance, etc.)
   • Deployment Roadmap timeline — 5 milestones from 2024 to 2030,
     with green checkmarks for completed phases.
   • UN SDG Cards — shows alignment with SDG 09, 16, and 17.

   How it works in code:
   • Purely static data (arrays of objects) rendered with .map().
   • Framer Motion "initial → animate" transitions make elements
     slide in from left/right or fade up when page loads.
   • No timers or intervals — this page is fully static display.


HOW PAGES ARE CONNECTED (ROUTING)
──────────────────────────────────
Next.js uses "file-based routing" — each folder inside /app/
automatically becomes a URL:

  /app/page.tsx                      → localhost:3000/
  /app/mesh-topology/page.tsx        → localhost:3000/mesh-topology
  /app/cyber-vault/page.tsx          → localhost:3000/cyber-vault
  /app/strategic-intelligence/page.tsx → localhost:3000/strategic-intelligence
  /app/silicon-lab/page.tsx          → localhost:3000/silicon-lab

The Sidebar component links to all these routes so users can
navigate between pages without a full page reload.


HOW TO RUN IT LOCALLY
──────────────────────
  1. Open a terminal in the indra-net/ folder
  2. Run:  npm install      (first time only)
  3. Run:  npm run dev
  4. Open: http://localhost:3000


KEY DESIGN CHOICES
──────────────────
  • Dark theme (#0A0A0A background) = military operations feel
  • Cyan (#00F2FF) = normal/active state
  • Green (#00FF9C) = success/nominal
  • Red (#FF3131) = alert/failure
  • All "live" data is simulated with JavaScript timers —
    no backend server or database is needed.
