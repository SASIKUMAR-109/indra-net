  INDRA NET — Sovereign Defense Communication System
  HOW IT WORKS
================================================================

OVERVIEW
--------
INDRA NET is a next-generation, indigenous mesh communication
network designed for India's defense and border operations.
It provides secure, offline-capable, low-latency communication
across remote and high-altitude terrain where satellite or
conventional networks are unavailable or too expensive.


CORE TECHNOLOGY
---------------
1. MESH NETWORKING
   - Multiple low-cost nodes (each < ₹15,000) form a self-
     organizing wireless mesh.
   - Operates on 433.5 MHz cognitive frequency bands.
   - Each node can route data through up to 3+ hops.
   - If one node fails, the mesh automatically reroutes
     (self-healing network).

2. FREQUENCY HOPPING SPREAD SPECTRUM (FHSS)
   - The system rapidly hops between frequencies to avoid
     jamming and interception.
   - Makes it extremely resistant to electronic warfare.

3. ENCRYPTION
   - Hardware-level AES-128 encryption on every node.
   - Zero-Trust architecture: every connection requires
     a valid HMAC-SHA256 handshake before data flows.

4. DIGITAL TWIN
   - A real-time 3D simulation mirrors the live network.
   - Used during R&D to cut development costs by 70%.
     (₹75 Lakh with Digital Twin vs ₹2.5 Crore traditional)
   - Fidelity: 99.8% match between simulation and hardware.

PERFORMANCE AT A GLANCE
------------------------
  Latency         :  12 ms          (vs 600ms+ satellite)
  Setup Time      :  < 1 hour       (vs 3–6 months satellite)
  Cost per Node   :  < ₹15,000      (vs ₹2–5 Crore satellite)
  Offline Capable :  YES
  Jamming Resist  :  FHSS Active
  Encryption      :  AES-128 Hardware
  Network Stable  :  99.8%
